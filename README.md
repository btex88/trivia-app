# Trivia App
Project developed in React with Redux and TailwindCSS.

## Why does this exist?
- This project was done as an evaluation at Trybe School used to mesure our knowledge in React and also our fluency in Redux.

### Main concepts used in this project were:
- Divide every function, functionality or element into components to better arrange and segment the code.
- Don't be afraid to use multiple reducers and transform local states into global ones.
- Use of CSS frameworks to help the development and improve the appealingness, in this case I've used TailwindCSS.
- Develop your logic into a ```src/service``` folder.
- Name all folders and files in __```kebab-case```__, JSX classes in __```PascalCase```__ and JS functions in __```cammelCase```__.
