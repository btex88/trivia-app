# Trivia App
Project developed in React with Redux and TailwindCSS.

## Why does this exist?
- This project was done as an evaluation at Trybe School used to mesure our knowledge in React and also our fluency in Redux.

### Main concepts used in this project were:
- Devide every function, functionality or element into components to better organize and segment the code.
- Don't be afraid to use multiple reducers and transform states into global states.
- Use the CSS frameworks to help your development.
- Develop your logic into a ```src/service``` folder.
- Name all folders and files in __```kebab-case```__, JSX classes in __```PascalCase```__ and JS functions in __```cammelCase```__.
